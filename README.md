This lab introduced fundamental web development tools and version control using Git and GitHub. The first step involved installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for coding, Git for version control, and Node.js for running JavaScript. Proper installation was verified using terminal commands to check version numbers.
Next, we created a basic HTML webpage inside a project folder named web-dev-lab. The index.html file contained a simple heading and paragraph. We explored different ways to open the file in a web browser, including using the Live Server extension for real-time updates.
For version control, we configured Git, initialized a repository, and connected it to GitHub. Using Git commands, we committed our changes and pushed the project online. Additional Git tasks included creating and merging a feature branch, modifying files, and practicing collaboration by forking a partnerâ€™s repository and submitting a pull request with meaningful contributions.
This lab provided hands-on experience with setting up essential tools, managing code with Git, and collaborating using GitHub. The structured approach ensured we gained confidence in both frontend development and version control workflows, which are critical skills for modern web development.
